# KnotzBubblePop

Welcome to KnotzBubblePop! This is a fast-paced, action-packed 2D space shooter game built with JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. You'll pilot your ship against waves of alien invaders, each with unique appearances and challenging patterns of movement. 

## Gameplay

You control a spaceship at the center of the screen. With each wave, enemies spawn from all directions and move towards your ship. Your goal is to destroy these enemies by shooting projectiles before they reach your spaceship. As you progress, the number of enemies and their speed will increase, raising the stakes and the challenge!

## Features

- **Dynamic Enemies**: Enemies in KnotzBubblePop aren't just mere shapes; they're fully formed alien invaders with unique images, bringing diversity and a sense of unpredictability to each wave. You'll never know what kind of enemy you'll face next!

- **Smooth Controls**: The game features simple and intuitive controls. You aim your ship's gun by moving your cursor, and your ship fires automatically, leaving you free to focus on the action.

- **High Scores**: Keep track of your highest score and challenge yourself to beat it!

## Future Enhancements

While KnotzBubblePop is fully playable, we're always thinking of ways to make the game more fun and engaging. Here are some of the features we're planning to add in the future:

- **Power-ups**: Boost your firepower, speed, and more with power-ups dropped by defeated enemies.
- **Boss Battles**: Face off against powerful boss enemies after surviving certain numbers of waves.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose your challenge with adjustable difficulty levels.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Compete with friends in an online multiplayer mode.
